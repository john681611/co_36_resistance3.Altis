# Resistance 3
![](http://i.imgur.com/Nqf157M.png)

## What is it?
A persistent Capture the island Pub sever mission for Arma 3

## Why would I like it
Like being a armed hobo like in those survival games? Do you also like team play and fighting a whole island of well armed troops?
Then this may be for your chance to go from poorly armed resistance group to a disturbingly well armed load of hobos taking back Altis from the CSAT and AAF.

## What you need?
Just arma 3
Though if you want there is support for Task force Arrowhead Radio (TFAR)
