# Resistance 3
![](http://i.imgur.com/Nqf157M.png)

## What is it?
A persistent Capture the island Pub sever mission for Arma 3

## Why would I like it
Like being a armed hobo like in those survival games? Do you also like team play and fighting a whole island of well armed troops?
Then this may be for your chance to go from poorly armed resistance group to a disturbingly well armed load of hobos taking back Altis from the CSAT and AAF.

## What you need?
Just arma 3
Though if you want there is support for Task force Arrowhead Radio (TFAR)

## Server Admin stuff
This mission as current is persistant mission so its best to set the server up to run persistantly: 
See [BIS WIki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/server.cfg) for info.

Once all zones are taken the mission ends the next time you start the mission you will have a clean mission.

### Force New game
A new game can be forced in the mission start by setting the new game parameter
I reccomend doing this after a major update where the saving format may have changed.

### How the game is saved
The game has one main server save saved to the server profile. This contains:
* Master Game ID
* Completed Locations
* Vehicle / Box Saves
  * Content.

There are two player local saves. Their storage box and their loadout.

##Dev
The missions are generated by a python3 build script that uses the folder names in `maps` as a postfix for the built folder names. Files from common can be overwritten by putting those files in the maps folder file does have to be in the same location on the folder tree not just root.

### File Structure
├───built -- built mission folder
├───common -- common code to any mission
│   ├───CHVD  -- view distance module
│   ├───Client -- client only code
│   ├───outlw_magRepack 
│   ├───R3F_LOG -- logistics code
│   └───Server -- server side code
└───maps -- map template with mission.sqm, config and any other overrides.
    ├───.Altis -- postfix
    │   └───config --config folder

## Where Can I find more information
The boards by the play in mission will give you some critical information. 
Otherwise the main form is here [Wiki](https://github.com/john681611/co_36_resistance3.Altis/wiki)

## ACE + TFAR Conversion Notes:
This is not designed to be done on every map more on whats been requested. (Notes are from Altis conversion)

### Files
1. Copy already built vanilla map
1. Rename adding `_ACE_TFAR` before version marker
1. Open mission file in editor.
1. Add `ACE TFAR` to suitable names
1. Add `_ACE_TFAR` to save name variable in config/basic.sqf
1. initPlayerLocal.sqf disable `Revive_marker`,`BIS_fnc_dynamicGroups`
1. init.sqf disable `MagRepack_init_sv`
1. initServer.sqf disable BIS_fnc_dynamicGroups
1. ./Server/eos/functions/setSkill  disable `HandleDamage` event handler (ACE covers this)

### Editor
