"About Resistance" hintC [
"Resistance is a co-op mission about teamwork. Instead of being given everything in the toybox you have a limited amount of resources with which to complete your mission.",
"Your goal is to capture the cities of Kavala, Athira and Pyrgos. Along with the Six Airfields.",
"Along the way capture villages and towns to get more gear.",
"Capture military bases to get even more gear and forward spawns.",
"Capture towers to prevent the enemy from sending patrols into the cities",
"Captrue airfields to get aircraft, because that makes entirely too much sense these days.",
"All captured AOs will drop loot somewhere within the marker, use it to quickly resupply and advance!",
"Have fun playing! --Mike64"
